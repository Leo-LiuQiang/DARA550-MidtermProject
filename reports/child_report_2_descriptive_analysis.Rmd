## README  
This document serves as a summary report of the descriptive analysis outcomes, generated through the script  `code/02_descriptive_analysis.R`:   
  
- More descriptive analyses are performed to identify trends and relationships among the variables included in the Table 1.     
- Input files: `data/derived_data/data_clean.rds`  
- Output files: `outputs/descriptive_outcome_barplt.png`, `outputs/descriptive_countinuous_plt.png`, `outputs/descriptive_categorical_pieplt.png`, `outputs/descriptive_categorical_barplt.png`    
  
  
Make command for `code/02_descriptive_analysis.R` outputs:  
```{Make, eval=FALSE}
outputs/descriptive_outcome_barplt.png outputs/descriptive_countinuous_plt.png utputs/descriptive_categorical_pieplt.png outputs/descriptive_categorical_barplt.png: data/derived_data/data_clean.rds

## 2 Descriptive Analysis  
  
```{r, library, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
here::i_am("reports/child_report_2_descriptive_analysis.Rmd")
```

 
##### Outcome Variable  
  
  
```{r, out.width="30%", fig.cap="", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("output", "descriptive_outcome_barplt.png"))
```
  
The figure below is the distribution of the outcome variable `Death Status`, which is imbalanced.    
  
\ \   
  
##### Continuous Variable  
  
```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("output", "descriptive_countinuous_plt.png"))
```
  
- Age by Death Status (Histogram): The overall and survived patient's age distribution in the dataset are right-skewed.   
- Age by Death Status grouped by Diabetes Status (Boxplot): Patients died with diabetes are slightly older than those who died without diabetes.   
- Age by Patient Type (Boxplot): Hospitalized patients who died had a higher median age compared to those who returned home.   

\ \ 
  
##### Categorical Variables

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("output", "descriptive_categorical_pieplt.png"))
```
  
The pie charts above visualized categorical variables that included in the Table 1.     
\ \   
  
  
```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("output", "descriptive_categorical_barplt.png"))
```
  
- Diabetes by Death Status (Bar Plot): atients without diabites have a lower death rate than those with renal failure.  
- Renal Failure by Death Status (Bar Plot): Patients without renal failure have a lower death rate than those with renal failure.  
- Patient Type by Death Status (Bar Plot): The returning home patients have a evidently lower death rate than those with hospitalized patients.
